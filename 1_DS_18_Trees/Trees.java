        // Subtree - a smaller Tree held within a larger Tree
        // Size of Tree - number of Nodes
        // Depth of Tree - number of Nodes on the longest path Root -> Leaf
        // Depth of Node - number of Nodes on the path from Root (Root starts at 0)
        // Height of Tree - same as Depth
        // Height of Node - number of Nodes from that to the deepest Leaf (start at 0)
        // Diameter of Tree - number of Nodes on the longest path between any two Leafs
